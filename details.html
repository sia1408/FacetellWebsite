            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>Facetell utilizes the Xception model, a deep convolutional neural network that excels at identifying manipulated media. The architecture leverages depthwise separable convolutions to optimize feature extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. This allows Facetell to identify intricate inconsistencies in media that indicate manipulation.</p>
            <p>The system also employs transfer learning, fine-tuning pre-trained weights from the Xception model using a specialized dataset of over 90,000 real and fake images. This ensures the model's robustness across diverse deepfake scenarios. The Facetell inference pipeline is designed for real-time processing, providing rapid feedback to users through API integration.</p>
            
            <h2>Financial Overview</h2>
            <p>Facetell is positioned to generate revenue through multiple streams, including subscription-based web app access, business-to-business (B2B) partnerships with news agencies and online media outlets, and licensing agreements with government agencies for identity verification purposes.</p>
            <p>Our cost structure includes server costs, marketing expenses, and ongoing R&D. The server infrastructure scales with demand, leveraging cloud services to ensure reliability and responsiveness. Marketing efforts are focused on social media campaigns and partnerships to increase adoption.</p>
            <p>Projected revenues are expected to grow as we expand our market presence from Tier 1 cities to Tier 2 and 3, eventually entering international markets in Asia-Pacific and Africa. The financial model includes a scalable subscription pricing strategy to cater to both individual users and organizations.</p>
